# Firetool CLI

Firetool is a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows you to do everything you can't do with Firebase Web Console. Ok, not everything... But a lot of those ;)

## Installation

### Node Package

You can install the Firetool CLI using npm (the Node Package Manager).  Note that you will need to install 
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Installing Node.js should install npm as well.

To download and install the Firetool CLI run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g firetool
```

This will provide you with the globally accessible `firetool` command.


## Initialize
Once you have created a Firebase project, you can initialize the SDK with an authorization strategy that combines your service account file together with Google Application Default Credentials.
